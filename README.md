### How to use ###
- [x] Import datasets from csv using DB Browser for SQLite
- [x] Get the key statistics of the datasets using aggregate functions
- [x] Manipulate the DB (add columns, join tables)


## *Observations* ##
1. Higher the income higher the exam results
2. There are more states better in reading than in math
3. Places are very versatile and zip statistics deeply vary the state statistics
